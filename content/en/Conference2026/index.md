### Conference Aims and Topics

Modern Geography encompasses a broad spectrum of subjects, interacting with the natural, social, and human sciences, as well as with applied sciences and spatial planning. The 13th Conference of the Hellenic Geographical Society (HGS) "Geography Matters" aims to highlight the richness and diversity of Geography, placing special emphasis on bridging different approaches and interconnecting scientific boundaries.
In an era of significant changes and uncertainty, major challenges - such as the climate crisis, humanitarian disasters and intensification of social inequalities, and geopolitical tensions and authoritarianism in governance - necessitate innovative, interdisciplinary and multiscalar inquiries.
The Board of Directors of the HGS invites you to participate in the 13th International Conference by submitting thematic sessions proposals in any area of physical or human geography.
