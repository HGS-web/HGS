# History

The Hellenic Geographical Society (HGS) is a non-governmental, non-profit scientific society founded in 1901, but reorganised and effectively operational since 1919. In 1920, it was recognised by law as an "advisor" to the Greek government, instructing the Ministry of National Economy to subsidise it with a specific amount and granting it the right to publish its studies free of charge by the National Printing House.

Since its reopening in 1928, the GSA has been dedicated to the development of the field of geography. For more than 90 years, the HGS and its members have contributed to the advancement of geography. The primary purpose of the HGS is to promote geography by supporting and coordinating geographical research and teaching in Greece. The GGS organises the International Conference of the Greek Geographical Society every two years and also promotes other meetings aligned with the Society's objectives. In addition, the Society facilitates the participation of Greek geographers in the European and global geographer community through its official membership in the International Geographical Union (IGU), the European Geographical Society (EUROGEO), and the European Union of Geographical Societies (EUGEO).

Since its establishment, the dedicated people, strong intellectual foundation, and vision of the Greek Geographical Society have contributed to the service and promotion of geography. With your continued support, we are ready to continue this role into the next century.
