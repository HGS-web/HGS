# Function

__The Hellenic Geographic Society__ is run by a twelve-member Board of Directors. Its members are elected every two years at the General Meeting by the regular, up-to-date members through a secret ballot.

The General Assembly also elects six alternate advisors to replace regular members who have resigned or died, in order of the number of votes cast in the election.
